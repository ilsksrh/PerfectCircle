# PerfectCircle
Firstly, I tried to use command line interface with Java and IntellIiJ IDEA where i needed to create a new JPanel and add it to the JFrame. I wanted to draw a circle and to compare if it is perfect or not, however, it was my first time to make something like this and i failed
but anyway i will upload what i got.
Also there is version with html and JS, at least there you can see you drawing, I didn't get how To draw just the outline of the circle without filling it in
